booknet
=======
# Getting Started
Aside from the software listed on the course website / included in the provided vagrant configuration, the following python library is needed:

(https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login)
```
pip install flask-login
from flask.ext.login import LoginManager
```

I've copied the compiled version (compiled on the class vagrant configuration) of this module to the root directory of the project as well.

# Initializing Database
* Import latest database data with the following command run from the root directory of the project:
```
gunzip < data/data-dump.sql.gz  | psql booknet -U postgres
```

* Now you can run BookServer.py to start the project / flask.

* As an aside, the book covers that were able to be downloaded and used for our project are at: http://goo.gl/7twwVq. However it should happily fail with blank images without that ~350MB download.
